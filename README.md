Currying is a technique of transforming the evaluation of a single function so that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument (partial application).

This technique is extremely useful when used with Promises.

In this example, I attempt to extract titles from books and diag codes from medical procedures.
